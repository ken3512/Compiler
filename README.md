# Compiler
A compiler I coded in Systems Software

The required elements were:
  1. A virtual machine to execute commands
  2. A lexer to tokenize the symbols
  3. A parser to parse the tokens
  4. An assembler to generate code

The grades I got on the following four projects where:

vm.c : 85%
lex.c : 95%
parser.c : 98%
codegen.c : 100%
